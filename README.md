# BusinessCard
A friend of mine asked me if I would be able to make a simple website that would be a business card for the company. <br>
Because of the simplicity of such a site, I decided not to create it using Spring Boot. <br>
I decided to create it using HTML, CSS and to keep it from being boring it was PHP. <br>
Plus I wanted to get to know PHP because I had never created anything in it. <br>
